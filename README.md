GITHUB Repository: https://github.com/lachie222/ChatApp


GIT Repository and Usage:
For phase 1 of this project, I regularly used git and github to backup and save. At the end of each working session, I committed and pushed to the master branch with a short message describing what I had done since the last commit. For phase 2 of the assignment, a new branch will be created to separate phase 1 and phase 2 projects.

Data Structures:

Users:
Users are represented on the server-side inside a User class file which defines the properties of a user (these include, username, email, password, role and a unique ID). Users are also represented in a serialised JSON file, which is used for storing each user for later retrieval. 

On the clientside, a single user is represented in sessionStorage as a JSON object. It is initially received from the server-side at login.

Groups:
Groups are represented on the server-side inside a Group class file which defines the properties and methods of a group (these include groupname, array of channels, array of groupassis's, addChannel function). Groups are also represented in a serialised JSON file, which is used for storing each user for later retrieval.

On the client-side, a user's groups are represented in sessionStorage as a JSON object. It is initially received from the server-side at login and can be retrieved/updated through further calls to the server.

Channels:
Channels are represented on the server-side inside the group class file as its own class which defines the properties and methods of a channel (these include channelname, array of users, adduser function). Channels are represented in server-side storage inside the channels array of their respective groups.

On the client-side, a user's channels are represented inside the channels array of the aforementioned groups sessionStorage JSON object. 

Angular Architecture:

Components:

Login Component: The login component is loaded at the root of the application, and represents all the logic and html required to send a login/authentication request or registration to the server. 

Control Panel Component: The control panel component represents all the logic and html required to perform admin functions such as creating/deleting groups, promoting users, etc.

Groups Component: The groups component represents all the logic and html required to display the users' available groups and channels as a list. This component also contains a form only visible to admins or group assis' to create/remove channels.

Chat Component: The chat component represents all the logic and html required to display the chatbox of the selected group/channel combo. The chatbox fetches chathistory from the server and displays it on screen. The component also contains forms to create a message and invite users to the chat.

Services:

FetchDataService: The fetchdata service represents the functions used to fetch group data and check group assis's. Since most requests on the web app involve updating groupstorage data (anything that affects groups, channels, users in channels etc), it is useful to refresh and refetch the data after a change has been made. The checkGroupAssis function is also included to loop through group data and identify if a user is a groupassis or not.

Models:

Models were not used in this phase of the assignment

Routes:

Angular routes are utilised to navigate to each of the components.
The root of the application '/', loads the standard application component, which also loads the login component. Once a user is authenticated, the login component will automatically route to the groups component. Also, once a user is authenticated, the navbar will display a link for the groups component (named chat), and also the control panel component if the user is an admin.

In the groups component, clicking on a link to a channel will route to the chat component with the group and channel name as parameters to the component.

Finally, the logout button will route back to the root of the application where the login component is located.

Node Server Architecture:

Modules:
Each custom module is located under the app_modules directory
Auth: The auth module contains all the logic required to authenticate users and register new users. The auth module also contains fetchgroups.js, which is used to retrieve and send group data.

Group: The group module contains the class definitions for groups, chats, and channels, JSON file storage for groups and chats and the javascript required to perform functions on each of these entities.

User: The user module contains the class definition for a user and the JSON file used to store users.

Functions:
app.post('/api/auth') -> used for authenticating users,

app.post('/api/register')-> used for registering a new user,

assignID()-> used to automatically assign each user in the JSON storage a unique ID number

app.post('/api/fetchgroups')-> used to return groups to the front end

app.post('/api/createchat')-> used to create a chat message from a req and store in chathistory

app.post('/api/retrievechat)-> used to return chat history to the front end

app.post('/api/creategroup)-> used to create a new group and store in groupstorage

app.post('/api/removegroup)-> used to remove a group from storage

app.post('/api/createchannel)-> used to create a new channel and store in groupstorage

app.post('/api/removechannel)-> used to remove a channel from storage

app.post('/api/adduser)-> used to add a requested user to a channel

app.post('/api/removeuser') -> used to remove a requested user from a channel

app.post('/api/promotesuper) -> used to change a requested users role to superadmin

app.post('/api/promotegroupadmin)-> used to change a requested users role to groupadmin

app.post('/api/promotegroupassis)-> used to promote a requested user to groupassis of a requested channel

Global Variables:
Global variables include the JSON files containing group, user and chat storage data.

Client-server responsibilities:
The angular front end is only used for display purposes. The only data that is processed from angular is a users role for displaying user/admin content, whether they are logged in and the group/channel names to use as inputs for forms, and navigating to a chatroom. Any other form of data processing is done by sending a http request to the server. The angular front end will also prohibit a user from accessing admin functions by choosing not to generate the html components required for them. The server-side also checks roles within each function to ensure this can't be bypassed.

The server-side is responsible for all data processing and storage. Any request to make a change to a group (adding, updating, deleting) is done via a http request, the server will perform the function of the request and the server will return JSON objects containing messages, groupdata and/or userdata. 

Client-server interaction:
As mentioned before, when any change to a data object needs to be made, the angular front end will send a http request to the server. The server will check that request, complete the requested function and then return a message and/or some data.

Using the chatbox as an example: Upon loading the component, angular will send a request to the server to obtain the chat history for that channel. The server will receive the request and run a function to match the request parameters to the chat object in the chathistory JSON file. If a match is found, the server will then return the chat history of that chat object back to angular to display. Angular will then update the display with the chat history

If angular wishes to create a new chat message, it will send a request to the server to create a message for the channel. The server will process it according to the request parameters, and send back a message to angular saying it was a success. Once angular recognises the chat creation was successful, it will send another request to obtain the chat history again, in order to display the newly created message.


Known Bugs/issues:

-	Fetchgroupdata will fetch all groups in the system regardless of user (I ran out of time to implement fetching user specific groups)

-	Group data will only update once the component is reloaded (possibly also an issue with fetchgroupdata service. If the fetchgroupdata service function is implemented directly into each component, data will update realtime. Could be an issue with latency?)

-	Because group data doesnâ€™t update instantly, a timeout has been used on login to allow groups to load on the next page (only works sometimes). Not a major issue, just requires user to click in and out of components to see new data (chat works fine for some reason, even though its implemented the same way).
